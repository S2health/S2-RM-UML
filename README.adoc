At the moment, the generated site does not display from GitHub pages properly in a browser. You will need to clone this repo and look at it locally in a browser. To make this work, you may need to make https://docs.nomagic.com/display/MD2021x/Web+Publisher+2.0+report[this adjustment] to your browser launch command line. This site is generated from MagicDraw tooling and right now, there is nothing we can do about the display issue.
