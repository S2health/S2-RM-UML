# S2-RM-UML
S2 UML site

At the moment, the generated site does not display from GitHub pages properly in a browser. You will need to clone the [UM repo](https://github.com/S2health/S2-RM-UML) and look at it locally in a browser. To make this work, you will need to make [this adjustment](https://docs.nomagic.com/display/MD2021x/Web+Publisher+2.0+report) to your browser launch command line. This site is generated from MagicDraw tooling and right now, there is nothing we can do about the display issue.
